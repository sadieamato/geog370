    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>For this map, I used geoprocessing to take a closer look at a topic I previously mapped (see my <a href="../hw1/hw1.html">HW 1</a>).
        First, I uploaded the Apex Residential Development polygons and the Apex Transit Stop points to QGIS as normal. Then, I projected the data
        into a local NC projection that uses meters to better use the geoprocessing tools. I used the buffer tool to create a 0.5 mile buffer around
        all the transit stop points to simulate the areas around the stops where I believe the general population would possibly walk to the stops from.
        This is obviously not a perfect science, since distance is not the only barrier to walkability, but it is what I am studying in this map.
        Next, I used the intersect tool to create a new layer where the transit stop buffers overlapped with the neighborhood polygons. Displaying this
        area on the map, in contrast with the area outside the buffer, answers the question about what proportion of neighborhoods in Apex are
        within 0.5 miles of a transit stop.</p>
