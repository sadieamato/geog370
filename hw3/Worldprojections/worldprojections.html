    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <p>To display the world map in different projections, I first added the Natural Earth data to the project using the data source manager.
        At first, the data was shown in EPSG: 4326 projection, and to see the distortion present in this projection I clicked on the Indicatrix Mapper
        plugin's logo and clicked run. To switch the map to a new projection and see the corresponding effects, I clicked on the EPSG number on the bottom
        right of the project. Next, I searched for the projection I was looking for, either by its name or its EPSG number. Then I selected the new projection
        and clicked OK for the project to switch into a new projection. This way, I could view the world's continents in different projections.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h4>This cylindrical projection projects the world onto a rectangular shape. In doing so, it slightly distorts both
        the shape and area of the land. From the Indicatrix Mapper marks, we can tell that this projection
        stretches the land horizontally and shrinks the land vertically, but it doesn't appear to alter the distances. It also 
        distorts the area somewhat, making the masses closer to the poles larger. Overall, however,
        this projection mainly manages to minimize the distortion of the land while shaping the Earth into a rectangular
        shape that is suitable for online graphics that must be rectangular.

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h4>The World Aitoff projection projects the world onto an ellipse, helping the viewer see the Earth as round.
        The land's shape and area is somewhat distorted in this projection. The area of the land close to the poles
        appears slightly larger than that at the Equator. Additionally, the land's shape and distance is stretched vertically closer to the poles,
        and this effect is amplified on the shapes found on the corners of the image.

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h4>This projection projects the world onto a rectangular (nearly square) shape. In doing so, the area of the land is changed dramatically.
        This projection does maintain the correct shape of all the land masses, but it appears to quadruple the area of the shapes closest 
        to the poles. Additionally, the distance on the map is stretched vertically by this projection. Overall, this projection is very useful for 
        seeing the shape and area of the land masses closer to the middle of the Earth,
        but it is only useful for seeing the shape of the more northern land masses. 
    </h4>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I Projection</h2>
    <h4>The Sphere Winkel I projection is fairly similar to the Aitoff projection. It also projects the world onto 
        an ellipse, evoking a round Earth. However, this ellipse has a shorter semi-major axis than the Aitoff projection. This projection 
        also seems to distort the distances present less than the Aitoff projection.
        The land masses are slightly distorted in this projection, both in shape and area. The land masses at the 
        poles are slightly larger in area and more elliptical in their shape. The ones at the corners are also stretched
        more than the masses in the center. 
    </h4>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h4>This cylindrical projection projects the world onto the longest rectangle we have seen thus far. Correspondingly, the shapes
        closer to the poles are stretched horizontally, with the semi-major axis much longer than the semi-minor axis. However,
        this projection keeps the area of all the land masses equal and does not seem to distort the distances much at all.
        Therefore, this projection contrasts the Pseudo-Mercator
        projection in that it is very useful for seeing the world's area and distances, but not the world's shape.

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h4>This conic projection projects the world onto a circular shape with a small wedge removed. From the distortion of
        the Indicatrix Mapper marks, we can see that this projection severely enlarges the southern area of the globe and stretches
        its shape horizontally. However, a benefit of using this projection is that it preserves all the distances on the map. It would 
        be a fairly well suited projection to use for a circular graphic.
    </h4>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h4>This Azimuthal projection appears fairly similar to the conic projection above. Contrastingly, however, this projection
        forms a complete circle. In doing so, the southern land masses are streched horizontally even more drastically. By examining these
        shapes, we can tell that the area and shape of some land masses is not preserved. However, a majority of the continents do seem
        to have an accurate shape and area. Additionally, this projection does preserve all the distances present.

    <h2>World Two Point Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h4>This projection maps the world onto a tilted circle shape, again evoking the roundness of the actual Earth. 
        The distortion effects of this projection vary a lot depending on the location; there are some masses drastically 
        stretched horizontally, but most masses' shapes are preserved and their area is only somewhat distorted. The main benefit
        of this projection, however, is the fact that it is an equidistant projection and does not distort distances.

    <h2>Sphere Patterson Projection</h2>
    <h4>This cylindrical projection is similar to the cylindrical ones previously discussed. In particular, it appears very alike to
        the WGS84 projection. However, the distances closer to the poles seem to be stretched slightly more than in the WGS84 projection.
        This projection also distorts the area and shape of the land massses, since the circles closer to the poles are enlarged and slightly 
        squished into an elliptical shape. Overall, while this projection does distort area, shape, and distance, it does so minimally and so it
        could be a very useful projection.
