    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>To display the world map in different projections, I first added the Natural Earth data to the project using the data source manager.
        At first, the data was shown in EPSG: 4326 projection, and to see the distortion present in this projection I clicked on the Indicatrix Mapper
        plugin's logo and clicked run. To switch the map to a new projection and see the corresponding effects, I clicked on the EPSG number on the bottom
        right of the project. Next, I searched for the projection I was looking for, either by its name or its EPSG number. Then I selected the new projection
        and clicked OK for the project to switch into a new projection. This way, I could view the world's continents in different projections.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h4>This projection projects the world onto a rectangular shape. In doing so, it slightly distorts both
        the shape and area of the land. From the Indicatrix Mapper marks, we can tell that this projection
        stretches the land horizontally and shrinks the land vertically. It also distorts the area somewhat. Overall, however,
        this projection mainly manages to minimize the distortion of the land while shaping the Earth into a rectangular
        shape that is suitable for online graphics that must be rectangular.
        
        Some observations: For each map, the description explains the pros/cons of the projection in terms of what it preserves and what it distorts (e.g., distance, shape, area).</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h4>The World Aitoff projection projects the world onto an ellipse, helping the viewer see the Earth as round.
        The land's shape and area is somewhat distorted in this projection. The area of the land close to the poles
        appears slightly larger than that at the Equator. Additionally, the land's shape is stretched vertically closer to the poles,
        and this effect is amplified on the shapes found on the corners of the image.

    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
    
    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h4>This projection projects the world onto a rectangular (nearly square) shape. In doing so, the area of the land is changed dramatically.
        This projection does maintain the correct shape of all the land masses, but it appears to quadruple the area of the shapes closest 
        to the poles. Overall, this projection is very useful for seeing the shape and area of the land masses closer to the middle of the Earth,
        but it is only useful for seeing the shape of the more northern land masses.

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I Projection</h2>
    <h4>The Sphere Winkel I projection is fairly similar to the Aitoff projection. It also projects the world onto 
        an ellipse, evoking a round Earth. However, this ellipse has a shorter semi-major axis than the Aitoff projection.
        The land masses are slightly distorted in this projection, both in shape and area. The land masses at the 
        poles are slightly larger in area and more elliptical in their shape. The ones at the corners are also stretched
        more than the masses in the center.
