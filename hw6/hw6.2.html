<h1>Homework 6.2: Census data choropleth methods of classification</h1>

<!-- For each map add a title that describes the ratio and the mode used to categorize the data. 
    On a webpage explain the ratio that you did and the reason for creating that ratio. 
    Also discuss breifly the pros and cons for each classification scheme. -->

<!--- Map 1 --->
<h3>Chosen Ratio:</h3>
<p>The ratio that I created for this map is the number of people in NY counties with 3 or more risk factors per 100 people. This ratio can also be 
    defined as the percentage of the population that has 3 or more risk factors. See description of the risk factors used in this dataset 
    <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/community-resilience-estimates/technical-documentation/methodology.html">here</a>. I created this ratio
    because, without normalization, this choropleth would likely look extremely similar to a population distribution map of NY. Since the total population 
    is partly composed of the high-risk population, I used the total population as the denominator in my ratio.

<h2>NY's High Risk Population: Normalized with High-Risk Population / Total Population and Classified with Equal Intervals</h2>

    </a>
<p>In the first map above, I used the Equal Interval classification scheme. As we can see, there doesn't appear to be much variation in most of the state.
    This is partially a result of the fact that the Equal Interval classification method can obscure vast differences within categories (we cannot 
    decipher any differences between all of the tan colored counties). On the plus side, equal intervals/bins are very natural for our brain to categorize
    things, so it is easier to understand this scheme. It also clearly illustrates that Bronx County's population has a much higher percentage of high-risk individuals than any other county.</p>

<h2>NY's High Risk Population: Normalized with High-Risk Population / Total Population and Classified with Equal Counts (Quantile)</h2>

    </a>
<p>In this map, I classified the data with the Equal Counts (Quantile) method. This method puts the same amount of counties into each category, so it 
    produces a map that looks much more varied. Additionally, with this map we can see differences between more of the counties outside New York City.
    However, this method obscures the fact that Bronx County is a high outlier (at 42%), since it appears in the same category now as counties that were in
    the 24.6% - 30.4% bracket in the previous map.

<h2>NY's High Risk Population: Normalized with High-Risk Population / Total Population and Classified with Natural Breaks</h2>

<a href="../pngs/ny-risk-natbreaks.png">
    <img src="../pngs/ny-risk-natbreaks.png" alt="Map of New York's population with 3 or more risk factors by county, classified with the natural breaks method" width='700px'>
    </a>
<p>Lastly, I used the Natural Breaks method to classify the data for this map. As can be seen, this map appears to be somewhat in between the two previous
    ones. This method splits the data at "natural" places, so it tends to reveal outliers and differences fairly well. We can see the lowest and highest counties
    here, and there is not as much difference obscured as in the Equal Interval method. The main drawback to this method is the fact that the bin sizes are variable,
    meaning the legend and map as a whole will be harder to quickly understand.
