<!-- Description of map -->
<p>
    This map displays what percentage of each county in North Carolina has low access to a grocery store.
    In this dataset, 'low access' is defined as "living more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large grocery store 
    if in an urban area, or more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store if in a rural area."
    I classified the categories in this map using the Natural Breaks method, which clearly shows the high
    outlier in the data set: Hyde County, with 90% of its population having low access to a grocery store. 
    The map also reveals that the adjacent coastal counties also have relatively high low access percentages.
    Most of the more metropolitan counties fall in the 15.7%-24.1% low access category, and more rural counties
    appear to have higher access based on this metric. It would be interesting to me to map this same topic
    with a slightly different definition of 'low access', i.e. perhaps changing it to mean living over 0.5 miles from a 
    grocery store in urban areas and over 5 miles from a grocery store in rural areas. The map may change if we
    use an alternate definition.

    I selected this topic because access to healthy foods is typically a good indicator of the health of the 
    community. I also have noticed how my own grocery store access differs when I live on campus without a car, 
    vs off campus with a car, vs at home with a car. Groceries are essential for nearly everyone, so this seemed 
    like an impactful topic to examine in my home state. Finally, I selected this topic because there was data 
    readily available for it! If I have an interesting topic but no data at the right geographic scale, I cannot map the topic.
